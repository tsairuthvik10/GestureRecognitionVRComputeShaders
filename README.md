# GestureRecognitionVRComputeShaders

This is a sit at home project that I did during the Quarantine. I implemented a gesture recognition system in Unity for VR using the PDollar 2D gesture recognition algorithm.

You can create new gestures and the gestures are stored as an xml file using Unity's presistent data path. Then, users can recognize their created gestures too.

I also implemented some compute shaders as pyramids with variable length on a sphere and used this to show off different spheres with different Pyramid variable lengths and textures using gesture recognition.
